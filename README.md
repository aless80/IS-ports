# IS-ports
This script can be added as a TemperMonkey extension to Chrome. 
This script adds a small container (a <div>) to the webpage corresponding to certain InterSystems web applications. The container includes two buttons and an input field. 
The container is added on the top of page and allows the user to relaunch the same URL at a different port number. 
Please refer to the @include tags in the script to see on which websites this script is active.
